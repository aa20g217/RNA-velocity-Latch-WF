RNA velocity analysis allows us to infer transcriptional dynamics that are not directly observed in a scRNA-seq experiment using a mathematical model of transcriptional kinetics. We can use RNA velocity to determine if a gene of interest is being induced or repressed in a give cell population of interest. Moreover, we can extrapolate this information to predict cell fate decision via pseudotime trajectories.
